    “Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small
things brought together.”

    伟大的事物不是一时冲动造就出的,而是由一系列微小事物组成的.

    -- Vincent Van Gogh


AS MY WATCH TICKED OVER TO 6 P.M., I KNEW I WAS IN TROUBLE. First of all, I was late, and not fashionably late either. In fact, at the time, I was about as unfashionable as you could get for someone staring 18 down the barrel. Long hair, Iron Maiden t-shirt, baggy camouflage trousers, and a thumping-great leather jacket. I left my parents’ house and got into my small van, adorned with oversized speakers and a tree-shaped air freshener. It was time to roll.

**当手表指向下午6点,我知道,有麻烦了!**
首先,我肯定要迟到了,
其次,我如此的不合时宜,坚定的留着长发,穿着 `Iron Maiden` T恤,宽松的迷彩裤,巨大的皮夹克.
离开父母家,钻进我那装饰着超大扬声器和树形空气过滤器的面包车中.到摇滚时间了!


.. sidebar:: `Iron Maiden <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden>`_
    :subtitle: 英国重金属摇滚乐团    

    1975年成立的著名乐团,甚至于有航班以其为名!
    下文提到的 `The Number Of The Beast Cassette <http://www.discogs.com/Iron-Maiden-The-Number-Of-The-Beast/release/442658>`_ 是他们最流行的专辑之一!


“Rolling” was optimistic. Instead, I sat bumper-to-bumper in traffic with half of Southern England, all joined in curiosity about whether or not that film with Michael Douglas could become a reality on this cold English day

"摇滚"是乐观的.但是,要在摩肩接蹱的交通干道中穿过半个南部英国,而且在英国经典的寒日里出行,苦逼哪!

This wasn’t helping my nerves. As a fairly outgoing, angsty teen, nerves were not usually my bag, but tonight, I was dining on them.

You see, tonight was different. Tonight I was doing something unusual, something that had seemed like a great idea...when I wasn’t running 30 minutes late, hammering my way down the motorway, with my Number of the Beast cassette ritualistically sacrificed to the gods of hi-fi just for good measure.

作为相当外向的问题青年,神经质从来不是我的范儿.
但是,今晚,却逃避不了了.
是的,今晚是完全不同的!
今晚,我要作些不同寻常的事儿,看起来是绝妙的事儿...
当然,要在没有迟到30分钟, 只好用给 hi-fi 之神最好的祭品~ `Number of the Beast cassette` ,不断锤打高速公路之前 ;-(

Thankfully, the world’s longest mechanical conga line decided to crank it up a notch. Before I knew it, I found myself on a street I had never been to, in a city I had never been to, about to head into a room full of people I had never met before, all united by one simple symbol...A penguin.

值得庆幸的是,世界上最长的机械康加舞蹈队列,终于开恩,放出个小裂口,解脱了我.
于是,在我反应过来之前,已经站在完全陌生的城市,完全陌生的街道,将一头扎进塞满完全陌生的各国人士的房间,
这一切只是由一个符号关联起来...一只企鹅.

An hour before, that penguin had seemed so inviting and friendly. It was a symbol that encompassed everything about the movement it represented, a movement that came together in spirit and mind to build a system that drove a new generation of technology and freedom... a movement that celebrated this drive by forming user groups in unknown streets, in unknown cities, and with unknown people.

一个小时前,企鹅似乎很热情和友好.
这个符号代表了一种运动,
这一运动用未知的系统将精神和心灵紧密联接起来,
推动了新一代的技术和自由,
从陌生的城市/街道聚集起来的不明身份的人,共同推进了这一运动.

But as I stood there, doorbell already pressed, none of that was even close to my conscious thoughts. Instead, the brain of one Jonathan E. J. Bacon was battening down the hatches, preparing for ultimate, unparalleled discomfort as I walked into a place I both did and didn’t want to be at the same time.

但当我站在那里,按响了门铃,
那一瞬间,大脑是空白的.
`如同 Jonathan E. J. Bacon ...`
好似同时处于门里和门外的状态,这带来无与伦比的不适.

Then the door opened and a rather nice chap called Neil welcomed me into his home.

然后门开了,名叫 Neil 的相当不错的小伙子将我迎进了他的家.


Community is a funny beast. Most people—the kind who watch talent shows on television and occasionally dip bread in oil in an expensive restaurant—don’t understand people like Neil. Why on earth would this guy decide to open his home, free of charge, to a collection of strangers who met on the Internet? Why would he want to spend an evening drinking tea and making jokes about something called “Emacs”? And why would he fund online resources like fliers, a mailing list, and a website from his own pocket; start a book-lending service for the group—and even shell out for tea and biscuits?

社区是头风趣的野兽.
大多数人--那种电视中展示的成功人士,在昂贵的餐馆里用面包偶尔蘸着橄榄油的人--是不会明白 Neil 这类人的.
为何地球上会存在这种家伙?
能免费在家召集仅仅在互联网中认识的陌生人集会?
为什么愿意整个晚上只是喝茶,以及对着一个叫"Emacs"的东西开玩笑?
为什么会自掏腰包发布各种在线资源,如文件,邮件列表,或是网站;
又为什么甚至掏出茶和饼干来启动用户组的借书服务?!


One person who really didn’t seem to understand was Neil’s wife. Somewhat bemused, and referring to us as his “Internet friends,” Neil’s significant other decided tonight was the night for visiting a long-lost (or possibly ignored) relative, rather than sticking around and faking interest.

Neil 的妻子确实很不明白.
我们是如何成为他的 "网友" 的,
而 Neil 今夜决定...
