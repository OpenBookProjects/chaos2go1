协作驱动气质 collaboration-driven ethos
===========================================================================


But Neil is not unusual. At least, not in the Open Source, Free Software, Libre, and Free Culture world. There are many Neils all over the globe, organizing groups, setting up mailing lists, scheduling meetings, and coming together to share an ethos: the combined set of beliefs, customs, and sentiment that flows between like-minded people.
但尼尔是不寻常的。至少，不是开源，自由软件，自由报，与自由文化世界。有许多世界各地的Neils，组织组，邮件列表，安排会议，来一起分享一种精神：结合一套信仰，习俗，和志同道合的人之间流动的情绪。


In the past 10 to 15 years, we have seen Free Culture in technology, art, and the media explode into our consciousness. The entire machine is driven by people like Neil; people who volunteer themselves to the concepts of community and togetherness wrapped around such an ethos.

在过去的10到15年中，我们已经看到了自由文化，技术，艺术，媒体爆炸，我们的意识。整个机器是由尼尔喜欢的人谁志愿者社区缠这样的风气和团结的概念

There are Neils outside the Free Culture world, too. They’re in church groups, helping the poor and unfortunate; in Neighborhood Watch and Meals on Wheels campaigns, reaching out to those around them; and in public art installations, political groups, and craft fairs. They volunteer, perform, and share their opinions and creativity on anything from aerobics to knitting to yoga.

外自由文化的世界，也有Neils。他们在教会团体，帮助穷人和不幸，邻里守望及膳食车轮上的活动，深入到周围的人，以及公共艺术装置，政治团体及工艺品集市。他们的志愿，执行，并分享他们的意见和创意上任何东西，从健美操针织瑜伽。

What intrigued me when I first walked into Neil’s living room was the concept of a collaboration- driven ethos, although at the time I had no idea what those words meant. What that experience taught, and what that evening inspired in me, was an excitement about what is possible when you get a group of people together who share a common ethos and a commitment to furthering it.
是什么吸引了我，当我第一次走进尼尔的客厅的合作风气的概念，虽然当时我不知道那话是什么意思。的经验教训，和那天晚上，在我的启发是什么，什么是可能的，当你得到一个组的人一起分享共同的精神气质，并承诺进一步兴奋。


In my world, that ethos has thus far been Free Culture, Free Software, digital rights, and breaking down the digital divide, but it can be as critical as creating world peace or as fanciful as sharing photos of kittens playing guitars on the Internet. The importance of community is not in the crusade, but in how you unify people to march forward together, side by side.

风气在我的世界里，是迄今自由文化，自由软件，数字版权，并打破数字鸿沟，但它可以为创造世界和平的关键或共享照片在互联网上弹吉他的小猫撒娇的。社区的重要性是不是在十字军东征，但在如何统一人们共同前进，并肩。


At its heart, The Art of Community is a distilled set of approaches and thoughts about how to build community. The book is a collection of experiences, observations, and thoughts from my career and elsewhere. My aim is to bring this grab bag of concepts and curiosities together into one consistent text.
在它的心脏，社区艺术是蒸馏的方法和想法，如何建立社区。这本书是从我的职业生涯和其他地方的经验，意见和想法的集合。我的目标是把这个大杂烩的概念和好奇心，一起到一个一致的文本。

However, it is important that we keep the book in perspective in the wider scheme of your growth as a community leader and organizer. You should mentally frame the content here as a foundation for your own ideas, but remember that practical experience is the real magic that we want to create, with theory merely the glittery jacket and spinning bow tie.
然而，重要的是，我们把这本书作为一个社会的领导者和组织者，在更广泛的计划，你的成长角度。你应该精神框中的内容为基础对你自己的想法，但要记住的实际经验，我们要创建，理论仅仅是闪闪发光的外套和旋转领结是真正的魔法。

Community is fundamentally a soft science. Compare it with, for example, programming. If you want to write a computer software application, you write it in a programming language. These synthetic languages are vessels of logic. They live and breathe in a world where the answer to a question is either yes or no; there is no maybe. In a world where maybe does not exist, you can plan ahead for an answer. With community, the importance and diversity of the question is equally essential.

社区本质上是一种软科学研究。 ，例如，比较它与编程。如果你想编写一个计算机软件应用程序，你把它写在一种编程语言。这些合成的语言是逻辑的船只。他们的生活和呼吸的世界里，一个问题的答案是“是”或“否，有没有可能。在这个世界上，也许不存在，你可以提前规划的答案。随着社会的重要性和多样性的问题是同样重要的。

.. topic:: MAPPING OUT THE JOURNEY

    In this chapter we are going to be exploring the big-picture attributes that are present in

    This chapter was designed for tea and snacks. Go and grab some, curl up in a chair, and get ready to explore the social schematics of your community.
