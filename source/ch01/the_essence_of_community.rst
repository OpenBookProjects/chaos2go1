the essence of community

`LugRadio`_

On February 26, 2004, three friends and I released the first episode of a new audio show called
LugRadio. Although LugRadio will be featured extensively in this book as a source of stories, all you really need to know about it right now is that (a) it was a loose and fun audio show (a podcast) about open source and free culture, (b) on that day it was entirely new, and (c) we had absolutely no idea what on earth we were doing. Radio personalities across the world were not exactly shaking in their boots.

Recorded in a very small room that I called a studio, but was actually a bedroom filled
with secondhand recording equipment, LugRadio involved my three compadres and me opining into four precariously balanced microphones that fed into a computer. Episode 1 was around half an hour long, composed of bad jokes and a book review, and totally unpolished. At the time, it was just new and different. Little did we know that four years later we would wrap up the show having achieved over 2 million downloads. Anyway, enough of the self- congratulatory back-patting and back to the story....

With the show out, we did what many of us in the open source world do—we set up forums, wikis, and channels, and tried to get people together around our new project. The forums went online first, and people started joining.

The 22nd member was a guy called Ben Thorp, known as mrben on the forums. An Englishman living in Scotland, mrben was an open source enthusiast who stumbled onto the forums, listened to the show, and liked what he heard. For the four years that LugRadio lasted, mrben was there every single day: in total contributing over 3,000 posts; involving himself in the chat channel, the wiki, and the organization of the live events; running an episode download mirror; and much more. Mrben was there every step of the way, loving every second of it.

The first question is, Why? Why does a 30-something Engli-Scot decide to immerse himself so deeply in a group of people he has never met before? What is it that makes him want to spend time away from his friends and family to contribute to a radio show performed by four strangers in a different country? Why would he want to contribute to something with seemingly no financial, career, or other conventional benefit to him?

A cynic could argue that mrben is some kind of socially challenged nerd who can only communicate with other similarly socially inept nerds. Conventional wisdom sometimes argues that anyone who freely contributes his time to something that could not benefit him financially is weird. This was clearly not the case with Ben. He had a job, a wife, and a child. He went to church regularly. When I had the pleasure of socializing with him, I found him a fun, smart, and entertaining part of the group. In fact, at two of the live events, he was a guest in my home. Social deviation was clearly not the answer, or if it was, he hid it well.

The reason why Ben was so involved in LugRadio, why Neil ran the Linux User Group meeting, and why thousands of other community members around the world get together, comes down to one simple word: belonging.


By definition, a community is a collection of people (or animals) who interact with one another in the same environment. Community exists everywhere in nature. From people to penguins, from monkeys to meerkats, the vast majority of organisms exhibit some form of collective grouping. Grouping, however, is a touch simplistic as a means to describe community. It is not merely the group that generates community, but the interactions within it. These interactions, and the feeling of belonging that they produce, are generated from a distinctive kind of economy: a social economy.


the essence of community
------------------------------------

At this point in our journey, it is clear that belonging is our goal. It is tha t nine-letter word that you should write out in large letters and stick on your office wall. It is that word that should be at the forefront of your inspiration behind building strong community. If there is no belonging, there is no community.

From the outset, though, belonging is an abstract concept. We all seemingly understand it, but many of us struggle to describe it in words. I identify belonging pragmatically: as the positive outcome of a positive social economy. In the same way that we judge a strong financial economy by prosperity, wealth, and a quality standard of living, belonging is the reward of a strong social economy.
An economy is a set of shared concepts and processes that grow and change in an effort to generate a form of capital. In a financial economy, participants put goods and services on the market to generate financial capital. The processes and techniques they use include measuring sales, strategic marketing, enabling ease of access, and so forth. A social economy is the
same thing—but we are the product, and the capital is respect and trust. The processes and techniques here are different—open communication mediums, easy access to tools, and so on—but the basic principles are the same.

OPEN SOURCE IN THE ECONOMY

Stephen Walli, a prominent commentator on open source in business and review editor for The Art of Community, drew some interesting connections between the underlying concepts in a financial economy and how they apply to the open source social economy. He presented these thoughts in his piece titled “Free and Open Source Software Developers Working for Free (Economics 101)”:

`Free and Open Source Software Developers Working for Free (Economics 101)`_

    People value their skill sets differently in different contexts, but value them they do. I use writers as an example to explain this to nondevelopers: a technical or marcomm writer may spend 8 hours a day at their paid job, then spend their evenings and weekends teaching ESL classes at the local college, working on a newsletter for their local church/synagogue/neighborhood organization, helping a child with a school project, and writing a sonnet to their significant other (or the next great novel or screenplay). In every case they’re using their writing skills; they’re just valuing them differently in different contexts.

    There’s another way to look at it. Not every market involves exchanging money for goods and services. A gem of an economics book (Reinventing the Bazaar by John McMillan, 2002, p. 135) points out that well- designed markets, regardless of market type, have a number of things in common:

        • Information flows smoothly.
        • People can be trusted to live up to their promises.
        • Competition is fostered.
        • Property rights are protected, but not overprotected.
        • Damaging side effects on third parties are curtailed.

    Let’s look at well-run free and open source project communities in terms of such market dynamics:

        • Information flows smoothly—transparency of community, process, code, policy, bugs, discussions.
        • People can be trusted to live up to their promises—the project’s license is a social contract. Its governance culture is well understood and supported.
        • Competition is fostered—what fixes and features are accepted, and which ones don’t make it.
        • Property rights are protected, but not overprotected—code copyright management and licensing is handled properly in well-run projects.
        • Damaging side effects on third parties are curtailed—the point here from the book is that WHEN real damage might be done to third parties, there are ways governments can involve themselves in the market to curtail such effects, whether by defining/enforcing property rights, taxes/incentives, or policy/regulation. The community’s license comes to mind.

    Individual projects behave as markets from one perspective, and code is currency, the medium of exchange. Just like all economic exchanges, the contributor offers something they value less (a fragment of code solving a particular need) for something they value more (the functioning software package in its entirety). Nobody is working for free in an economic sense.

Social capital is known by us all, but we know it by many different words: kudos, respect, goodwill, trust, celebrity, influence, supremacy, greatness, and leverage, to name a few.

The first known use of the term social capital (referred to in Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community [Simon & Schuster]) was by L. J. Hanifan, a school supervisor in rural Virginia. Hanifan described social capital as “those tangible substances [that] count for most in the daily lives of people: namely goodwill, fellowship, sympathy, and social intercourse among the individuals and families who make up a social unit....”

Social capital is the collective family of positive interactions between two or more people. When you affect someone positively (this could include being generous, helping someone, sympathizing over a problem, or something else), it has ripple effects on the community you and he are a part of. In addition to creating goodwill for you (increasing your own social capital), it strengthens the other person and the community in ways that ultimately benefit your social capital, too. Hanifan identifies the opportunity behind social capital::

    The individual is helpless socially, if left to himself...If he comes into contact with his neighbor, and they with other neighbors, there will be an accumulation of social capital, which may immediately satisfy his social needs and which may bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community. The community as a whole will benefit by the cooperation of all its parts, while the individual will find in his associations the advantages of the help, the sympathy, and the fellowship of his neighbors.


The meat in Hanifan’s description is the opportunity for social capital to “bear a social potentiality sufficient to the substantial improvement of living conditions in the whole community.” In essence, if a member of your community has a positive approach to another member, her social capital grows, which has a positive impact on that person and the community as a whole. It all sounds a lot like karma, and it is.

Of course, capital, whether monetary or social, is not the end game. People don’t make money for the purposes of just having money. They make money because it allows them to do other things.

This is an important aspect of understanding where an economy starts and ends. Most folks riding the financial economy are not purely greedy numbers freaks who just want a big pot of money; most people who work with social capital are not merely air-kissing, hand-waving, superficial animals who simply want to name-drop and be name-dropped in the interests of social acceptance. Of course, the greedy and the socially obsessed do exist, but it is important not to use them as a basis for judgment. The economy is not flawed; those people are flawed.

A final point: for an economy to work, every participant needs to believe in the economy. Belief is a critical component in how any group of people or animals functions. This can be belief in God, belief in values, or belief in a new future. Whatever the core belief is, the economy and the community can be successful only if everyone has faith in it.


So let’s have a quick recap:

    • A sense of belonging is what keeps people in communities. This belonging is the goal of community building. The hallmark of a strong community is when its members feel that they belong.
    • Belonging is the measure of a strong social economy. This economy’s currency is not the money that you find in your wallet or down the back of your couch, but is social capital.
    • For an economy and community to be successful, the participants need to believe in it. If no one believes in the community that brings them together, it fails.
    • Like any other economy, a social economy is a collection of processes that describe how something works and is shared among those who participate.
    • These processes, and the generation of social capital, which in turn generates belonging, need to be effectively communicated.


So far, we have talked extensively about our goals (belonging), the medium of exchange (social capital), and what is at the heart of an economy (processes). We now need to focus on the final component that binds each of these concepts together: communication.

In many ways, an economy is like a flowing river: it never stops, and the flow is critical to its success. Economies never stand still. Every day they change, adjusting to stimuli in the world that affects them. At the heart of how this movement works is communication.
